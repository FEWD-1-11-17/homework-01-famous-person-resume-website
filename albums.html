      <p class="bio">
        Springsteen has released records steadily since 1973, and is widely known for his brand of heartland rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered on his native New Jersey. The E Street Band have been Springsteen's primary backing band since 1972 and have appeared on a majority of his 18 studio albums and 16 live releases.
