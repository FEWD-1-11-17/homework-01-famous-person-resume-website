<h2>Resume</h2>

<h4>QB Coach 2000-2005</h4>

<p>Prior to the start of the 2005-2006 season, Taylor was promoted from QB coach to head coach. Many locals, including the voice of Panther football Slammin' Sammy Meade, suspected Taylor only got the promotion over longtime offensive coordinator Mac McGill because of Eric's relationship with star quarterback Jason Street. Taylor had been Street's personal QB coach since the quarterback's pee wee days and developed him into an All-American quarterback. Along with Street, Taylor commanded one of the most talented Panther teams in recent memory which included record-setting junior tailback Smash Williams and bruising fullback Tim Riggins.</p>

<h4>Head Coach 2006-2007</h4>
<p>But expectations to win immediately crumbled as Street suffered a career-ending spine injury in the season opener that left him paralyzed from the waist down. Taylor was forced to turn to seldom-used sophomore Matt Saracen for the rest of the game and, eventually, the season. Taylor molded Saracen much like he did Street and simultaneously became a very important father figure in Saracen's life, whose own father was serving in Iraq.</p>

<h3>TMU</h3>
<h4>2007</h4>
<p>After accepting the position of QB coach at TMU, and not wanting to uproot his family, Taylor moved to Austin by himself. But being away from home proved to be more difficult than expected and Taylor soon found himself yearning to be back. Meanwhile, the Panthers floundered under new head coach Bill McGregor and main booster Buddy Garrity looked to bring Taylor back. Taylor acquiesces, but trouble arose as he attempted to resign from TMU. Furthermore, upon his return to Dillon, Taylor learned that his old job is not secure because McGregor planned to fight his early termination.</p>
<h3>East Dillon Lions</h3>
<h4>Head Coach 2009-2010</h4>
<p>Tasked with rebuilding a football team decades past its prime, Taylor received help from some unlikely places. He struggled to find dedicated players and staff, but was given a diamond-in-the-rough athlete in Vince Howard and Panther running back Luke Cafferty, who was illegally enrolled at West Dillon. He also received the free services of Stan Traub, a huge admirer of Taylor's and Pop Warner "Coach of the Year 2005." Taylor's rebuilding football team mirrored the rebuilding community of East Dillon, as the town gathered around their rediscovered pride.</p>
