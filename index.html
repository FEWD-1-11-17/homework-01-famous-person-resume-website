        <p> Tiger Woods was born on December 30, 1975 in Cypress California to Earl and Kultilda Woods. Growing up in Orange County, California, he picked up the game of golf at the age of 2, and practiced at his father's naval golf course - Joint Forces Training Bases in Los Alamitos. In 1978, Tiger Woods was considered a childhood golf prodigy and was featured in a television appearance on The Mike Douglas Show (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XupL9h0DOc" target="_blank">video</a>). In his youth, Tiger attended Stanford University and won 3 consecutive U.S. Amateur Titles and the NCAA individual golf championship. He briefly attended the university for two years, and turned professional in 1996. In his first year as a tour professional, Tiger won his first major at the Masters in 1997 (the youngest ever winning at the age of 21) and ascended to the #1 spot in the world in two months. Tiger wrapped up his 1997 career debut with 8 PGA tours wins, including the PGA Championship.
