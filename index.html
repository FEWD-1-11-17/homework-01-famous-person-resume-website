    <h1>The Orange Robot</h1>
    
    <p class="main">
    Moby The Robot is an orange robot who communicates in beeping noises. The three lights on his chest light up when he beeps, and Tim usually translates what he's saying. Moby is Tim's friend but loves to drive him crazy. Moby helps out by fetching things for Tim and asking questions about the topic they are discussing. As a robot, he can do things that people are unable to do, such as changing his hand into a freeze-ray, sending himself back in time, throwing garbage into a black hole in space, removing his head, and using lasers.
