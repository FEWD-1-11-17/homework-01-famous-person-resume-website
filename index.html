      Hi, I'm Minerva "Minnie" Mouse, and you may know me as the girlfriend of the one and only Mickey Mouse. I made my debut in the Disney animated short <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBgghnQF6E4">Steamboat Willie</a></em> in November 1928, and I've been delighting audiences ever since. I've been described as sweet-natured, and I always love to have fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favorite hobbies include fashion, spending time with my sweetie, Mickey, and having fun with friends at the Disney Parks.
