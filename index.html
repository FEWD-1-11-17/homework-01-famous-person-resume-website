        <h1>Scott Hansen</h1>
        <p> I am a San Francisco, California based musician (Tycho) and artist (ISO50). I created the ISO50 site originally to house my design work in a portfolio format but over the years it has grown to encompass a shop, clothing line, and blog. I have spent time as a freelance designer and worked for a few agencies, most notably, perhaps, Adobe. In the end I dropped my freelance practice and went solo to focus on my own design and music. This has given me the chance to delve into the style of design I truly enjoy creating and not be swayed by the various trends that seem to perennially filter the collective output of the design world. I record music as Tycho and create visual work as ISO50.

        <h2>The Road to What I'm Doing Today</h2>
        <p>It’s been a long and winding road, but it all started with design and music evolving concurrently. In high school, I did pen and ink drawings, but never thought of art as a potential career. In college, I got a copy of Photoshop, and right around that time, I also got some damaged audio equipment from a friend—that set me on the path of thinking about how music was made. I was getting into drum &amp; bass and electronic music and, for the first time, I sat down and wondered how that type of music was created. I started thinking about the creative process and the fact that there are people out there who apparently make music for a living, and that it’s possible. I started making mixtapes and little recordings of my own, which I also designed covers for.
        </p>

        <h3>Creativity Was Always a Part of Me</h3>
        <p>I was very much involved in art as a kid, spending most of my time obsessively drawing. But the world doesn’t exactly encourage kids to try to go on these creative career paths, so I never saw art as a future—it was more of a hobby. It was just something I did that I loved, but I also knew I needed to go to college and get a job. I can’t point to any moment in my life when there was a big, courageous moment where I said, “Oh, I’m going to do it.” It was always very metered and measured out. I did creative things in my spare time while I had a day job, until it reached a tipping point.
