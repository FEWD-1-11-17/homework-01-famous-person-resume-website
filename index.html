    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>
      The son of a wealthy industrialist, Daniel "Danny" Rand was orphaned as a 10-year old child while on a family quest to find the mystical city of K'un L'un -- a land largely hidden from the world whose inhabitants experienced immortality due to the protection of the dragon Shou Lou the Undying. Growing up among the inhabitants of K'un L'un, Danny was trained in martial arts in preparation for the trial of the Iron Fist where the city's top warrior challenges the dragon Shou Lou to combat. If successful, the combatant gains the power of the Iron Fist to protect the city against external forces. Having won this privilege at the age of 19, Danny decided instead to return the New York City in search of the man he believed was responsible for the loss of his parents many years before.
