    <h3>Career</h3>  

    <p>
      As the daughter of actor Jon Voight, I appeared in the media from an early age. Over my career, I have acted in 46 films, produced 9, and directed 5. I am a 5 time award winner, with 10 additional nominations for my work. I was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and in 2011 had an endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton.

    <p>
      I was named a <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/goodwill-ambassadors.html" target="_blank">UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador</a> at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001. On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, I was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner Antonio Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In this expanded role, I represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.
