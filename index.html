        Minerva "Minnie" Mouse is best known as the girlfriend of Mickey Mouse. Minnie made her debut in the Disney animated short <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBgghnQF6E4">Steamboat Willie</a></em>, released on November 18th, 1928, and has been delighting audiences ever since. Minnie can be on the Disney Junior show <em>Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</em> as well as in many Disney animated cartoons. Minnie's iconic polka dots have made her a style icon, and she has been seen in over 100 different outfits. Minnie is available to meet guests at all of the Disney parks.
